					Hello, my name is Pablo Ramirez and I
					will be an incoming Freshman at
					Fresno State University. I am a student
					at Fowler High and am attending the
					Bitwise Industry my senior year. I am a
					Junior Web Developer and am pursuing
					a career in computer science. I	am 17
					years old, love to watch and play sports
					and am really into programming. My life
					has been filled with roller-coasters going
					up and down.

						As you can see from the image above. I
						am a huge Soccer Fan. Ever since I was
						a little kid, soccer has been my passion.
						I like to play and watch it. I have many
						other hobbies like playing xbox, coding,
						watching tv, exercising and many more
						things.
				</p>
				<p>
						When I was a small kid, I always loved
						the fact that things could do	certain
						tasks. Just looking at the way that
						games, phones, computers ran, made
						me look into technology. When I was 15
						years old, it was the moment I decided to
						get into programming. It has always
						been a dream to be able to own my own
						company and make games for people to
						enjoy.
